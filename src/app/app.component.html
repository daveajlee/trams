It is a fun computer game where you run your own fictional transport company and have to ensure passengers arrive at their destination on-time! If your vehicles are delayed in traffic then you need to take action to get them back on schedule before your passengers get frustrated and leave for another transport operator. Can your transport operator stand the test of time or will your passengers take your company off the road/rails? Play TraMS and try to run a successful transport company now!</p>
